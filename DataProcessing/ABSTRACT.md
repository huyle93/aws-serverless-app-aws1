# Abstract

**Wild Rydes – Serverless Data Processing**: Wild Rydes (www.wildrydes.com), the world’s leading unicorn transportation startup, needs your help! Our company has grown to thousands of unicorns fulfilling hundreds of thousands of rydes each day. Your mission is to collect, store, process, and analyze data to track the real-time location and health of our unicorns. In this workshop, you'll learn how to build infrastructure to process files on Amazon S3 and data streams in real-time using Amazon Kinesis. You'll build serverless applications using Amazon Kinesis Analytics to aggregate and summarize data, and use AWS Lambda to store aggregated data in Amazon DynamoDB. Finally, you'll use Amazon Kinesis Firehose to build a data lake in Amazon S3 and use Amazon Athena to run ad-hoc queries against it. Level 200
